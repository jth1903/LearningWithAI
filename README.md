# LearningWithAI - Python Learning Repository

A comprehensive Python learning repository featuring interactive lessons and a text-based adventure game. This project is designed to help beginners learn Python programming through hands-on examples and practical applications.

## 📚 Contents

### Python Lessons
The repository contains 8 progressive Python lessons covering fundamental concepts:

- **`lesson1_basics.py`** - Introduction to Python basics, variables, data types, and basic operations
- **`lesson2_strings.py`** - String manipulation and formatting
- **`lesson3_control_flow.py`** - Conditional statements and loops
- **`lesson4_data_flow.py`** - Data structures and flow control
- **`lesson5_function.py`** - Function definition and usage
- **`lesson6_error_handling.py`** - Exception handling and debugging
- **`lesson7_file_handling.py`** - File I/O operations
- **`lesson8_oop.py`** - Object-Oriented Programming concepts

### Adventure Game
- **`AdventureGame/adventure_game.py`** - A complete text-based adventure game demonstrating advanced Python concepts including:
  - Classes and objects
  - Game state management
  - Item combination system
  - Room navigation
  - Interactive storytelling

### Sample Files
- **`sample.txt`** - Example text file for file handling exercises

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- No additional dependencies required

### Running the Lessons
Each lesson can be run independently:

```bash
python lesson1_basics.py
python lesson2_strings.py
# ... and so on
```

### Playing the Adventure Game
```bash
cd AdventureGame
python adventure_game.py
```

## 🎮 Adventure Game Features

The adventure game includes:
- **Interactive storytelling** with typewriter-style text output
- **Item collection and combination system** - combine items to create new ones
- **Room-based navigation** with multiple interconnected areas
- **Inventory management** system
- **Weapon and combat mechanics**
- **Puzzle-solving elements**

### Game Commands
- `north`, `south`, `east`, `west` - Move between rooms
- `take [item]` - Pick up items
- `combine [item1] [item2]` - Combine two items
- `inventory` - View your inventory
- `look` - Examine current room
- `quit` - Exit the game

## 📖 Learning Path

1. Start with `lesson1_basics.py` to understand Python fundamentals
2. Progress through lessons 2-7 to build your programming skills
3. Complete `lesson8_oop.py` to learn object-oriented programming
4. Play the adventure game to see these concepts in action
